# Dissertation

This repository contains all the assets for my university dissertation project: To develop a classroom reward system using a computer game.

The purpose of the product is to create a web based game and allow teachers to reward students with in-game currency for classroom activities, within an educational context, in an attempt to facilitate extrinsic motivation.

All code generated here was created by me, or makes use of open-source libraries, and is avaible publically purely for demostration purposes. These code has been marginally edited for security reasons and therefor will not work if hosted independatly. Please do not attempt to host this project on the web, or steal elements of this code. The sole purpose of this is demonstrate my technical abilities to potential employers. 

This project is hosted online and intended viewers will have access to this web address. There is a complimenting report created for this project and again this is only avaible to potential employers.
