# Dissertation

This repository contains all the assets for my university dissertation project: To develop a classroom reward system using a computer game.

The purpose of the product is to create a web based game and allow teachers to reward students with in-game currency for classroom activities, within an educational context, in an attempt to facilitate extrinsic motivation.

All code generated here was created by me, or makes use of open-source libraries, and is available publicly purely for demostrational purposes. This code has been marginally edited for security reasons and therefore will not work if hosted independently. Please do not attempt to host this project on the web. The sole purpose of this is to demonstrate my technical abilities to potential employers. 

This project is hosted online and intended viewers will have access to this web address. There is a independently report created for this project and again this is only available to potential employers.
